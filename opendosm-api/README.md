# Goyave Template

A template project to get started with the [Goyave](https://github.com/go-goyave/goyave) framework. This project only contains the directory structure and basic server setup so you shouldn't have to clean up things you don't need.

- [Documentation](https://goyave.dev)
- [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/goyave.dev/goyave/v5)

## Getting Started

First, make your own configuration for your local environment. You can copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`.

Run `go run main.go` in your project's directory to start the server.
